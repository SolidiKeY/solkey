/// Wary first-order substitution operator (de Bruijn). Like [SubstOp] it replaces the bound
/// variable by the substituted term, but it does **not** push a *non-rigid* term across a modality,
/// behind an update, or into a transformer — doing so would be unsound, because the value of a
/// non-rigid term (e.g. a program variable) depends on the state.
///
/// This mirrors KeY-Java's `WarySubstOp` / `WaryClashFreeSubst`, adapted to de Bruijn indices.
/// Capture avoidance is automatic under de Bruijn, so the only "wary" concern left is state
/// dependence: when the substituted term is non-rigid and the variable occurs below a protected
/// operator, the substitution is left unreduced (a residual `{\subst …}` term). The `subst_to_eq`
/// rule can then introduce a fresh rigid Skolem constant capturing the term's current value, after
/// which the (now rigid) substitution is pushed through soundly.
